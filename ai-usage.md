### AI Usage & Reflection

> *"While AI is a great tool, and can massively speed up automation and scripting for CTFs, I don't think it replaces human thinking yet."*

## **Methodology**
I used AI in this CTF to write exploit scripts, generate payloads and analyse large volumes of data quickly. I then manually looked through the results and came to my own conclusions, I find this way of doing challenges much more efficient and satisfying than simply going back and forth with the AI until it eventually solves it. It also ensures I learn something and gain skills, rather than making myself a wrapper between the AI and the challenge, which is a waste of time.

## **Tools Used**
* **Google AI Pro:** Gemini 3 Pro
* **GitHub Copilot Pro:** Claude Opus 4.6
